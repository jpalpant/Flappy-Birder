What It Is
------------

Creating an automated player for the mobile game Flappy Bird using image processing in MATLAB and LabVIEW

Current State
-------------

After significant initial work in MATLAB, I eventually switched to LabVIEW to take advantage of my greater experience in that language and the simple instrument communication it provides.  This has resulted in an awkward blending of languages in the repository.

The software side has made significant progress - my LabVIEW is able to use template matching techniques with decent efficiency to identify the position of the bird in an image at a decent speed.  It is also able to use the model of the bird to plan a trajectory.  However, the parts haven't been integrated, and the hardware control is non-existent, so the project has stalled for the time being until I get a chance to work on it more.
